## calendar-assistant

* I've developed a backend solution to help employees book meetings, find free slots between two employees, and check meeting conflicts between participants. It's built using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL, ensuring efficient meeting management.


## System Features
* Meeting Booking
 > Employees can book meetings using a RESTful API with time slots.
* Find Free Slots
 > The system can find common free time slots between two employees based on their schedules, allowing meetings of a fixed duration (like 30 minutes) to be scheduled.
* Conflict Detection
 > The system identifies participants with meeting conflicts when trying to schedule a new meeting.
